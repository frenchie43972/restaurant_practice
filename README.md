Project Summary:

Built a one-page restaurant website for "The Good Plates" that emphasizes clean design, accessibility, and responsive behavior.

Navigation & Branding:
Developed a fixed navbar featuring a clickable logo that returns the user to the top. The navbar dynamically changes style on scroll, thanks to a concise JavaScript snippet.

Hero Section:
A hero section with an image slider showcases high-quality images of the restaurant and its offerings. The transitions between images are smooth, creating an engaging visual introduction.

Menu Section:
Designed a detailed menu section using semantic HTML and flexbox for layout. The section lists various food items with their prices in an organized, card-like format that's both visually appealing and responsive.

About Section:
The about section uses a flex layout to present multiple paragraphs describing the restaurant's philosophy, culinary approach, and ambiance, paired with an image of the establishment.

Location Section:
This section provides contact details along with an embedded Google Map, ensuring visitors can easily locate the restaurant. The map is made responsive using a container-based technique.

Footer:
The footer incorporates social media icons, copyright information, and a clickable logo to return to the top.
